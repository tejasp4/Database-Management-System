Every time I do select, it disregards the name of the column and just gives me the first one
i can do 
load students;
select Firstname from students;
 101 
 102 
 103 
 104 
 105 
 106

 it will print out just the SIDS
 
 it doesn't even have to be a valid column name
 i could just do, any string would be okay, and it would still print out 
 select five from students;

the SIDS

> select Firstname, Lastname from students;
Search result:
 104 Armstrong 
 102 Chan 
 103 Xavier 
 106 Chan 
 101 Knowles 
 105 Brown
